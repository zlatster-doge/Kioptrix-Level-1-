# Kioptrix Level 1 - RCE Walkthrough

## Objective

To gain root-level access to a target system (Kioptrix Level 1) by identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting misconfigurations, and performing post-exploitation analysis.

## Situation

The target system is discovered on a local network and suspected to be vulnerable due to outdated services. The goal is to enumerate the system, identify exploitable services, and leverage known vulnerabilities to achieve full system compromise.

## Task

- Identify the compromised system on the network
- Enumerate open ports and running services
- Research and exploit known vulnerabilities
- Gain root access to the system
- Perform post-exploitation activities such as credential extraction
